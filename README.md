Go to the Live Link which I provided above. You'll get a Mini Blog UI. You can read posts there. Before doing registration, you are just a guest and so you can only read the blog posts. After that, you have to register with your email, password and description to create post, category and manage them. Now, do login with authentic username and password to create post. After a successful authentication, you can create category, post and manage them from your personal dashboard. One more thing is as a normal registerd user, you can not delete any category. You are only able to update and delete your own post. Thank You.
